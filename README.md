# conways_game_of_life
Conway's Game of Life in Numbers

2 different programs

Logic - just birth and survived count is enough. Others are initialized to zero and later updated with birth and survived states
(birth = surrounding high states = 3)
(survived = surrounding high = 2 or 3)
And updation is done.

 
No visualization is provided. (just using python standard library(time, argparse) and numpy)

standalone - 'game of life'

py module - 'conway module' with main program as 'main conway'
